The raspberry Pi pico W is a RP2040 based microcontroller board very popular nawadays among hobbyist and in the industry basically for it's IoT capabilities enabled by it's powerful WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity capabilities.It is ussually programmed using Micropython
for python programs but it can also be programmed with C and C++, "the arduino programming language". Thonny was used to execute the python programs, and it can be installed by following the instructions given on the Thonny website: https://thonny.org/
A few simple sensor programs were written, executed and later, the Microcontroller was connected to the internet. This was achieved by the use of MQTT to stream temperature and hummidity data from AHT10 sensor to the Adafruit IO. learn MQTT from
https://mqtt.org/ and adafruit IO from Adafruit website https://io.adafruit.com/ . To use it, create an Adafruit account and hover to the Adafruit IO section. Follow a youtube video from Youtube or an AI language model, for instance ChatGPT or Google Bard to learn how to connect it to the platform.
