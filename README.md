The raspberry Pi pico W is a RP2040 based microcontroller board very popular nawadays among hobbyist and in industry for it's IoT capabilities from it's powerful WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities.It is programmed using Micropython
for python programs but can programmed with C and C++, "the arduino coding language". Thonny was used to execute this python programs, it can be installed by following instruxtions outlined in the Thonny website: https://thonny.org/
A few simple sensor programs were written executed and later, the Microcontroller was connected to the internet. This was achieved by the use of MQTT to stream temperature and hummidity data t Adafruit IO. learn MQTT from
https://mqtt.org/ and about adafruit IO from https://io.adafruit.com/ To use it, create an Adafruit IO account and hover to the IO section. Follow a youtube video from Youtube to learn how to connect t the platform.
